        <h2>Spring</h2>
        <p class="spring_p">Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter
            and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies
            according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn
            in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are
            approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the
            season progresses until the Summer Solstice in June (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern
            Hemisphere).</p>

        <h2>Summer</h2>
        <p>
            Summer is the hottest and brightest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn.
            At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are the longest and darkness hours are the shortest,
            with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunrises and latest
            sunsets also occur near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to
            climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern
            Hemisphere, and vice versa.

        <h2>Autumn</h2>
        <p>
            Autumn, also known as fall in North American English,[1] is one of the four temperate seasons on Earth.
            Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere)
            or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably
            shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length decreases and night length increases as the
            season progresses until the winter solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern
            Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves
            of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.

        <h2>Winter</h2>
        <p>
            Winter is the coldest and darkest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after autumn
            and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away
            from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition
            based on weather.

            When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
            Winter typically brings precipitation that, depending on a region's climate, is mainly rain or snow. The
            moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most
            negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on
            which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length
            decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
